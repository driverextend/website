      <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a software engineer interested in efficiency, optimization, modularity
        and all parts of future-proofing projects. I'm currently in my junior year at
        the University of Minnesota
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I'm working towards getting my Computer Science degree. In the meantime I have
        been spending my time by making games, optimizing my classes' code build/compile systems, developing
        the ui/fundamental design of an android app for my network research lab, and learning
        how to center a div ;)
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from everything computer science related, my interest vary. I like traveling to
        places that have cool architecture/terrain, learning languages (I've learned ASL, now I'm working on Spanish),
        and as of recently, reading (<i>The Martian, The Atlas Six, How to Win Friends and Influence People, ...</i>)
      </p>

      <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>

      <p>
        I collaborated on a 3D drone delivery simulation modeling the UMN campus for one of my classes, implementing
        design patterns (Observer,
        Decorator, Singleton) and pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra) in the C++ backend, while personally modernizing
        the
        provided build system with CMake and Docker for cross-platform compatibility and long-term maintainability.
      </p>

      <p>
        I developed a Minesweeper game for a different class, using linked lists, array lists, queues, stacks, and
        searching algorithms; incorporated
        ternary operations and optimization techniques to enhance performance and user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to Minesweeper, I developed a chess game, using object-oriented programming principles with a focus
        on high cohesion, using class-based
        structures and data encapsulation to manage game state, piece movement, and move validation. I even developed my
        own GUI for this, so I wouldn't have
        to use the terminal. It was a unique challenge, but it was fun!
      </p>

      <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>

      <p>
        I've been on the Dean's List for my freshman, and sophomore year so far.
        The U.S. National Science Foundation awarded me with the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
        Fellowship.
        And I got 100% of the achievements in Skyrim
      </p>

      <h2>üåÆ Work History</h2>

      <h3>UMN Networking Research Group</h3>
      <p>
        I'm developing the user interface and contributing to the architectural transformation of an Android network
        monitoring application used in a University of Minnesota graduate-level course, with the goal of creating an
        open-source tool for network research and education.
      </p>
      <h3>UMN Office of Information Technology</h3>
      <p>
        All of the classic IT responsibilities. Helping users through VOIP and remote sessions, managing
        secure information in the UMN Database (Azure, AD, etc.), and even showing users how to connect to the internet.
      </p>
      <h3>Starbucks</h3>
      <p>
        Making and drinking a LOT of coffee.
      </p>
